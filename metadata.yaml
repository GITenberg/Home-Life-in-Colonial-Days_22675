description: Though first published over a hundred years ago, "Home Life in Colonial
  Days" is filled with usefulness and vitality. In her wonderfully readable narrative,
  Alice Morse Earle provides a fascinating description of everyday life -- the chores,
  the tools, the dwelling places, the foods, the sights and sounds -- that Colonial
  Americans knew. Tough not a history of Colonial America, "Home Life in Colonial
  Days" contains many interesting tidbits about our country's earliest days. It also
  provides an excellent description of everyday life in America, with special emphasis
  on New England and Virginia during the 1600-1800's. As such, "Home Life in Colonial
  Days" would be useful not just to historians and antique collectors, but to writers,
  museum curators, and anyone who wants to understand Colonial America.
